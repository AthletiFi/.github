# Contributing to AthletiFi Sport Inc. & Pleyr

First and foremost, thank you for your interest in contributing to our projects! We are building **Pleyr**, a platform dedicated to empowering youth athletes, and we appreciate the time and effort you're willing to invest.

This document provides a high-level overview of how you can contribute to projects within the AthletiFi Sport Inc. GitHub organization.

## 🎯 How to Contribute

Our core platform, Pleyr, is developed internally. However, we may have other open-source tools, libraries, or projects where community contributions are welcome. The best way to contribute is often by:

- **Reporting Bugs**: If you find a bug, please create an issue in the relevant repository, providing as much detail as possible.
- **Suggesting Features**: Have an idea to make Pleyr better? We'd love to hear it. Please use the issue tracker to suggest new features.
- **Improving Documentation**: If you find parts of our documentation that are unclear or could be improved, a pull request is always welcome.

## 🚀 Getting Started with Code Contributions

If you're looking to contribute code to one of our open-source repositories, please follow these general steps.

1. **Check for Specific Guidelines**: **Before you start, please look for a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file within the specific repository you are working on.** Core repositories like our main web application have detailed setup instructions that you must follow. This document is only a general guide.

2. **Fork & Clone**: Start by forking the repository, then clone your fork to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/[repository_name]
    ```

3. **Create a New Branch**: Always create a new branch for your feature or bugfix. This keeps the commit history clean.

    ```bash
    git checkout -b your-feature-name
    ```

## 📝 Guidelines for Pull Requests

- **Adhere to Style Guides**: Follow the coding style, linting rules, and conventions used throughout the project. Check the repository's `README.md` for information on tools like ESLint and Prettier.
- **Write Clear Commit Messages**: Your commit messages should be descriptive and clearly explain the "what" and "why" of your change.
- **Keep It Focused**: A pull request should address a single issue or feature. Avoid mixing multiple unrelated changes in one PR.
- **Update Documentation**: If you introduce a new feature or change existing functionality, update the relevant documentation.
- **Ensure Tests Pass**: If the project includes tests, please ensure they all pass before submitting your pull request. Add new tests for your changes where applicable.
